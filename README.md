# The Kerbol B Sides
### Installation
1. Install Kopernicus and its dependencies via CKAN
2. Install BetterTimeWarpContined via CKAN. Not required, but I haven't changed the time warp altitudes yet, and it makes ion burns far less painful.
3. Install the latest version of Sigma Dimensions (https://github.com/Sigma88/Sigma-Dimensions). Note, you cannot use the CKAN version as it is not up to date!
4. Download the KSP-B-Sides zip folder, extract the files. Inside the folder you will find a GameData folder, and inside that folder there is another KSP-B-Sides folder. Drag this folder into your GameData folder. The Kerbol B Sides are not currently on CKAN.

### Recommended Mods
1. Better Time Warp.
### Overview
This is a mod for Kerbal Space Program that increases the difficulty of the stock star system by taking each world's characteristics and rapmping them up to 11. It is intended to be played by experienced KSP players looking for a challenge, with stock+DLC parts, in sandbox mode or science mode with high rewards.

### Backstory
When I first played KSP, everything felt impossible, until I did it. I remember I was so ecstatic the first time I landed on the Mun, it felt like I had climbed a mountain. One by one, I conquered the worlds, until one remained: Eve. My first ascent from Eve was one of my proudest moments as a KSP player.

However, the more I learned, the less difficult everything became. If I wanted to go to Duna, I wouldn't sketch out stuff, theorycraft, and put together a huge mothership, I'd make a small but efficient single stack and just go there. I tried my hand at low mass missions. Turns out, you can go everywhere in the Kerbol system in under 8 tons.

I tried rescales, RP-0, and planet packs to scratch the itch, and to a certain extent, they worked, but I always felt myself craving that sense of impossibility and achievement again.

The 2018 platformer Celeste is a difficult game with a well defined end point. However, beyond that end point there lies hours and hours of additional content if you want to keep going. Notably, each level has a "B side", which dials that level's quirks and difficulty up to 11.

A few weeks ago, I had the idea to make a B side modpack for KSP. Everything is still recognizable from stock. Rather than being a simple rescale, the worlds are all altered to accentuate what made them difficult in the first place.

### The Worlds

* Kerbol - Larger, more luminous (luminosity not currently working)
* Moho - In an even lower and wonkier orbit, with a hot, thin atmosphere and lava oceans, gravity and radius increases
* Eve - Gravity, radius, atmosphere height, and atmosphere pressure increases
* Gilly - Really does not want you to land on it. The Kraken crushed it, superglued it together, and spun it up. The only landing sites that won't fling you off into space are the poles.
* Kerbin - Gravity, radius, atmosphere height, and atmosphere pressure increases. Heightmap greatly exaggerated, be prepared to have to dodge the western mountain range on re-entry.
* The Mun - Gravity and radius increases. Brought closer to Kerbin, is now massive in the sky. A little easier than vanilla Tylo, but if you can master it, it will provide potent gravity assists.
* Minmus - Now located in a near polar orbit of Kerbin. Gravity and radius increases. Heightmap somewhat exaggerated.
* Duna - Gravity and radius increases. Atmosphere is now even thinner and shorter. The sense that it is too thin to be useful but too thick to be ignored is now exaggerated.
* Ike - Gravity and radius increases. Is now obnoxiously in the way, far moreso than before, with only a few kilometers of space in low Duna orbit safe to stay in.
* Dres - Dres doesn't exist, silly! If you do manage to find it, make sure to pack a lot of Delta-V and set your altimeter to ground mode.
* Jool - Moderately increased gravity. Now has a shallow ocean. It can serve as a warm-up for Eve.
* Laythe - Slight radius and gravity increases. Atmosphere thinned and shrunk. Moved really close to Jool. There is even less land exposed now, and the land that is exposed is harder to land on.
* Vall - The increased solar luminosity has melted some of it! Vall now has an ocean, and the remaining landmass is mostly very lander-unfriendly. Gravity and radius increases as per usual.
* Tylo - Gravity and radius significantly increased.
* Bop - The Kraken got curious and tried to make a black hole! It didn't work, of course, but Bop is now a small, extremely dense near spherical object with a surface gravity above 7g.
* Pol - Larger, and incredibly spiky. Orbit embiggened.
* Eeloo - Now in an even more distant elliptical orbit. Heightmap has been extremely exaggerated, its canyons now rivaling the great canyon of Dres. As it is ice, the surface friction has been significantly reduced, so make sure to find one of the few flat spots left! Gravity and radius increases, too.

## Known Issues - This is my first mod, help is welcome!
1. Oceans do not show up in the ScaledSpace versions of Moho and Vall. Kerbin's ScaledSpace model does not match up with its PQS model.
2. Moho's atmospheric halo is blue, when it is supposed to be red (I have tried a few things, help)
3. Portions of Laythe's terrain disappear sometimes
4. Jool's ocean does not play nice with low camera angles
5. Kerbol's luminosity increase does not work as intended, solar panels still generate the default amount of power.
6. The highest peaks on Kerbin and Pol exceed the fade-out distance for the PQS and are translucent. I can't figure out how to make my changes to these values actually get applied.
7. Time warp altitudes are unchanged from vanilla
8. Minimum safe altitudes are unchanged from vanilla, do not trust KER or the debug menu, you will crash into mountains.
