KSP B Sides Changelog


Version 1.1

Bugfixes:
* Fixed Duna-B being shown as Duna (displayName was misspelled as dispalyName)
* Fixed Bop-B being shown as Bop (displayName was written as name)
* Fixed Pol-B being shown as Pol (displayName was omitted)
* Remade Bop-B from scratch to fix an issue where it wouldn't render properly if below 600 meters above the surface (not sure how I didn't catch that) (This was an issue in development but I thought I had fixed it)

Changes:
* Bop-B is now smaller, 1800m radius vs around 2300m
* Bop-B gravity slightly increased (8G)
* Deleted a bunch of commented out configs to make things a bit cleaner

Additions:
* Bop-Bb, a submoon of Bop-B with incredibly high gravity (14G) and incredibly tiny size (5m radius) as a remnant of a funny test I did. It is pretty buggy but I thought I'd keep it in because there's got to be at least one person who was also curious as to what would happen if you made a world that small.

Known issues:
* Bop-Bb doesn't render properly unless you are inside its SOI, chalk this up to it being the Kraken's eyeball
* When in very low orbits around Bop-B and Bop-Bb the game thinks you are under acceleration and won't let you leave or time warp
